# Idea&Design Branch

## Description

The `Idea&Design` branch is dedicated to storing and managing all design concepts and models related to the project. This branch serves as a repository for character models, weapon designs, spaceship models, and environmental concepts. It is used to organize, track, and share initial ideas, sketches, and prototypes for 3D models, ensuring a collaborative space for all creative and design-related tasks before they are finalized and implemented into the main project.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `Idea&Design` branch is to:
- Provide a central location for all project-related model design concepts.
- Allow team members to contribute, collaborate, and iterate on visual aspects of the project.
- Keep track of evolving designs, ensuring that they are well-organized and easy to reference.
- Serve as a space for storing drafts, sketches, and detailed design descriptions for models that will later be developed into final assets.

## Key Areas Stored in This Branch

- **Character Models**: Design concepts and prototypes for all characters in the game, including visual appearance, outfits, accessories, and animation ideas.
- **Weapon Models**: Concepts for in-game weapons, including guns, melee weapons, and unique items.
- **Spaceship Models**: Design drafts and ideas for spaceships, including player ships, enemy ships, and large space stations.
- **Environment Models**: Concepts for game environments, such as cityscapes, alien worlds, interior designs, and backgrounds.

## Usage

To access and use the repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/anlongwannabexrdev/CryoCore-Protocol-Project.git
```
2. **Switch to the ModelDesign branch: If you're not already on this branch, run**:
```cmd
git checkout "Idea&Design"
```
3. **Add or modify models: Add new model concepts or modify existing ones. Each type of model (e.g., characters, weapons, spaceships, environments) should be placed in its relevant folder.**

4. **Commit your changes: After adding or modifying model concepts, stage your changes**:
```cmd
git add .
```
  - **Commit your changes with a clear message**:
```cmd
git commit -m "Added new idea design "
```
5. **Push your changes: Push your changes to the remote repository**:
```cmd
git push origin "Idea&Design"
```

### Contribution Guidelines
Model Contributions: Feel free to add new design concepts, sketches, or drafts for models. Make sure the models are categorized properly (e.g., CharacterModels, WeaponModels, SpaceshipModels).
Organize Models: Ensure the design files are stored in the correct folders to maintain structure and clarity.
Collaborate: Share your ideas and get feedback from team members. Collaboration is key for refining concepts and designs.
Respectful Collaboration: Be respectful of others' contributions and provide constructive feedback to help improve the overall design quality.
